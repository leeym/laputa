# Laputa
Laputa is a Java-based service framework and standardized RPC running in AWS Lambda.

It is inspired by [Wealthfront's Query Engine](https://www.slideshare.net/julienwetterwald/wealthfronts-query-engine) and built on top of [Kawala, Wealthfront's software platform](https://github.com/wealthfront/kawala).

Please use laputa-sample as the template to build your service.
